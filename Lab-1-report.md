## Datasets considered
We considered multiple datasets before narrowing it to 3 options We focused on computer vision datasets as we felt it to be more challenging than tabular datasets. We also took a smaller, tabular dataset.
Both smoker detection and music genre detection require the use of CNN (Convoluted Neural Networks).

### Smoker detection
- [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vitaminc/cigarette-smoker-detection)
- It has a 2 training datasets of people smoking and people not smoking.
- Uses CNN to identify if a person is smoking or not in a given image

### Pokemon with moves
- [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csobral/pokemon-gen-vii-pokedex)
- Uses the dataset to find the best possible move and pokemon to counter a specific pokemon

### Music Genre detection
- [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahemateja19bec1025/musicgenerationdataset)
- Uses a python library, librosa, to convert the audio clip into a spectrograph.

## Result
- We have selected 2 datasets: 1 tabular and 1 image processing.
	- Smoker Detection : It provides us with enough scope 
	- Pokemon with moves: Provides us with data visualisation to help us achieve our outcomes
- We decided to go with 2 datasets as the tabular dataset provides us with data visualizion and the image processing dataset allows us to work with a more complicated dataset and helps us challenge ourselves.
- We rejected the music genre detection as the spectograph generated would only be for a small clip, and not the whole song. As a result, only a certain part of the song would be recognised.
